A bit of history
----------------

[![Zombusters Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mYXBIZX9VgQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYXBIZX9VgQ)

This game started its development by the end of 2010 as a personal project that quickly escalated to a commercial project. It was published for the Xbox360 on November 5th of 2011. The next steps were the windows phone port release and finally the PC for the windows store and Desura on July 2014. It wasn't commercially a success. After that the game was something like abandoned until now. After 5 years of the first release on Xbox360 we though that would be cool to revive this project and make it open-source.

The code released is not the original (that included all the code for other platforms), it's a modification that aim to be released into Steam.


Roadmap
-------

Ok, it's been 6 years... as developers we evolve and a project with 6 years could be painful to manage, and more if there is no SOLID principles in it... this project is in that point.

To celebrate these 6 years we would like to make an special version that enhances it; and publish it sometime into Steam... so there is a lot of work to do:

* Automate builds and package generation. (CI) :heavy_check_mark:
* Refactor and Clean code. Apply SOLID principles at least.
* Update to latest version of Monogame.
* Improve controls.
* Improve scenes, remove blocking spots.
* Add more weapons and balance them.
* Add more Power-Ups.
* Add Level Bosses.
* Improve Leaderboards.
* Add achievements.
* Multiplayer.

(:heavy_check_mark: all marked with this symbol are "done / completed")
