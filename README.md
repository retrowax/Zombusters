A bit of history
----------------

[![Zombusters Trailer](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mYXBIZX9VgQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYXBIZX9VgQ)

This game started its development by the end of 2010 as a personal project that quickly escalated to a commercial project. It was published for the Xbox360 on November 5th of 2011 on XBLIG. There were a Windows Phone port released later that year and finally the PC for the Windows Store and Desura on July 2014. After that the game was something like abandoned until now, it's been almost 10 years of the first release on Xbox360 so we though that would be cool to revive this project and make it open-source.

The code released is not the original (that included all the code for other platforms), it's a modification that aim to be released for Windows (itch.io and Steam), MacOS and Linux.


Roadmap
-------

We would like to make an special version that enhances it. There is a lot of work to do:

* Automate builds and package generation. (CI) :heavy_check_mark:
* Add compatibility with MacOS and Linux.
* Update to latest version of Monogame.
* Improve controls.
* Improve scenes, remove blocking spots. :heavy_check_mark:
* Add more weapons and balance them.
* Add more Power-Ups.
* Improve Leaderboards.
* Achievements.
* SteamWorks features.

(:heavy_check_mark: all marked with this symbol are "done / completed")
